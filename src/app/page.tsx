      <p>
        Hi, I&apos;m Spencer Cain. I&apos;m a software engineer who builds
        practical, scalable tools—often from the ground up. A core part of my
        work involves developing AI systems from scratch, with a focus on
        performance, clarity, and control. This site is a working portfolio of
        what I&apos;ve made, what I&apos;m building, and how I think.
        You&apos;ll find code, projects, and thoughts that reflect my
        process—often in progress, occasionally polished, but always direct. The
        purpose of this site is twofold: to document and to share. Documenting
        helps me reason more clearly; sharing invites challenge and connection.
        If you&apos;re curious about how I approach problems, build systems, or
        think about tech, you&apos;re in the right place.
      </p>
